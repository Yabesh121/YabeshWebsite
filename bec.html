<i><b><font color="black">The faith, worship and practices of Believers Eastern Church are rooted in the Apostle's doctrines and Holy Tradition of the Holy Church. We believe in the Bible to be inspired

Believers Eastern Church adheres to the episcopal governance and structure embodied in Scripture and followed by the Orthodox Church Fathers.We believe in the priesthood of all
believers, yet we also believe that God of order who establishes lines of authority to strengthen the Church in serving Him and Humaniy.
</p>
We believe that each part of God's Church should be autonomous, meaning: self-propagating. Believers Eastern Church is led  by its own Metropolitan, The Synod, Conference of Bishops and
General Assembly. We function according to a well-defined constitution and have a Canon law for the governance of the Church. On every level, we follow the biblical model of multiplicity in
leadership, ensuring that no one makes unilateral decisions for the church.
</p>
Believers Eastern Church has its administration in conformity with the teachings of <b>St. Ignatius of Antioch (35-108 A.D.)</b> and <b>Cyprain of Carthage (200-258 A.D.)</b> They taught,"As the Lord did nothig
without the Father, being united to Him, neither do you anything without the bishop and clergy" ( The Epistle of St.Ignatius to the Magnesians, ch.7)
</p>
The central administration of the church is backed by the dioceses. Each dioces consists of a geographical grouping of churches and is led by an episcopa. Each one has its own council and assembly.
